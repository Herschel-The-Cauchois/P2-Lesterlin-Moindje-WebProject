            <p>This website has been passionately created by DaÃ¯f MOINDJIE and Raphael LESTERLIN as a part of our project for the TI402I course in the 2025 Spring semester!</p>
            <p>It has been born from an unwavering passion for wildlife from the both of us and more specifically for marine and underwater animals for my case.</p>
            <p>As for how we split the work, I (DaÃ¯f) was in charge of creating most of the HTML and CSS for the entirety of the four pages, and Raphael in charge of doing most things that are JS-related and the CSS of the game page.</p>
            <p>Basically I took the creative directions and he took the more practical ones.</p>
